#The scan method reads every item in the entire table and returns all the data in the table.
#You can provide an optional filter_expression so that only the items matching your criteria are returned. 
#However, the filter is applied only after the entire table has been scanned.
#The following program scans the entire Movies table, which contains approximately 5,000 items.
#The scan specifies the optional filter to retrieve only the movies from the 1950s (approximately 100 items) and discard all the others.

#ProjectionExpression specifies the attributes you want in the scan result.
#FilterExpression specifies a condition that returns only items that satisfy the condition. 
#All other items are discarded.
#The scan method returns a subset of the items each time, called a page. 
#The LastEvaluatedKey value in the response is then passed to the scan method via the ExclusiveStartKey parameter.
#When the last page is returned, LastEvaluatedKey is not part of the response.

#ExpressionAttributeNames provides name substitution.
#We use this because year is a reserved word in DynamoDBâ€”you can't use it directly in any expression,
#including KeyConditionExpression. 
#You can use the expression attribute name #yr to address this. 
#ExpressionAttributeValues provides value substitution. 
#You use this because you can't use literals in any expression, including KeyConditionExpression.
#You can use the expression attribute value \:yyyy to address this.
